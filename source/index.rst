The **ARPA2** project is an umbrella for open source projects that implement
the open source and open networking ideals of a secure, private and
decentral Internet.  In addition, most projects aim to be accessible to
less technically inclined users, for example through hosting providers that
can install the ARPA2 software stack.

To achieve its ideals of control by users over their online presence,
the individual projects adhere to an integral design, known as the
**InternetWide Architecture**.  It derives its name from `InternetWide.org`_,
the overall project frontal used to collect funds from which some vital
ARPA2 projects are funded.

This is definately an ambitious project, not just for its goals but also
for its size and intended impact.  We are happy to see many people in the
technical community to respond with great enthousiasm to our attempt at
integrating the software that we all love to use, and to make it into a
whole that is hopefully easy to install, but more importantly, that is
simple enough to manage and use to be of value to everyday users who
do not happen to have a technical background.

We integrate security and privacy as integral pieces of the design (the
InternetWide.org architect is indeed a cryptographer) but we never
loose sight of practical usability of what this brings.  So expect great
assets like single-signon, realm-crossover and bring-your-own-identity...
and to see it combined with users, groups, roles, aliases, pseudonymity.

*There's no reason we can't have it all... all it takes is a concerted effort!*
