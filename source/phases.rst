>   **Status:** The architecture of SecureHub and IdentityHub is crystal clear.
>   Coding of SecureHub is reaching a level where it is practically usable, the
>   work on IdentityHub has started.  Architecture of ServiceHub is relatively
>   clear, but only a few work items have been tackled.  SocialHub is developing
>   as an architecture, but is not completely clear at this point, although we
>   have a few resounding ideas standing by!
