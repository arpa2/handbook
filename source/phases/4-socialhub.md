ARPA2 phase 4: SocialHub
========================

>   *The SocialHub phase turns the Internet as a whole into a social network.
>   This is not a new idea in itself, but we have gotten used to thinking
>   social services are web-based and, as a result, located with a more-or-less
>   central provider.  This model has shown to be detrimental to our control
>   over online presence and privacy, so we turn it around.  Nobody minds a
>   web interface, but the heart of social networking should just be...
>   networking.  And by that, we mean at the level of the general
>   Internet Protocol, where everyone is an equal.*

Issues Addressed
----------------

This is the first phase of ARPA2, and it is targeted at letting people
build social networks, in which they can exchange snippets of information
in a variety of ways, either over peer-to-peer communication or using more
classical mechanisms, but always founded on open protocols and/or open
standards.
